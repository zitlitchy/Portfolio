## Details
Two APIs from Open Trivia Database are used here:

This part is for collecting user name, and let user choose the game category

### 2. Warm-up game

### 3. Main game logic
1. Questions are display randomly from question bank ```random.choice(question_bank) ```
2. Compile correct answer and incorrect answer into one list, then randomised the order of answer ```random.shuffle(answer_list)```
3. Add labels A-D to each answer for the ease of user input, the data will be stored in ```display_options```
4. Seprate all answer options into a ```correct_answer``` library and a ```incorrect_answer``` library
5. If user request a hint, ```hint()```will remove the first incorrect answer user first chose, then random choose one answer from the  ```incorrect_answer``` list and combine that with the ```correct_answer```. The two ```remaining_options``` will then be sorted by their label. User will have 50/50 chance to getting the right answer.
6. Counters are set to count the numebr of correct answer, incorrect answer and hint_requests in each loop
7. If the user's request hints more then the hint_quota, an error message will be displayed
7. A random choice of message will be selected from the template messages when user success or fail
8. ```display_options``` and ```Ã¬ncorrect_answer```will be clear in each question loop so to store new values as user enter a new question
